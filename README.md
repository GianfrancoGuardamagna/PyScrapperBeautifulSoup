# PyScrapperBeautifulSoup
The scrapper was created out of the necessity to fulfill certain descriptions on an e-commerce platform that I've been working on...

Firstly, it iterates through a JSON file called 'ODS.JSON', extracting the code of each product. Then, it proceeds to navigate through different sites, collecting more precise links to each item. Once inside an item's page, it scrapes its description and creates a .txt file containing both the article code and the description. This file can then be read with my JavaScript project to complete the designated descriptions.
